# Neutral Evolution in One- and Two-Locus Systems

## The Wright-Fisher Model

Its roots trace to Fisher (1922) and Wright (1931).

Assume:

- a diploid population with a fixed number of monoecious (hermaphroditic) adults
- random mating (self-fertilization included)
- discrete generations

Consider a locus with two alleles B and b, without selection advantage

## Loss of heterozygosity by random genetic drift

## Probabilities and times to fixation or loss

## The age of a neutral allele

## Allele-frequency divergence among populations

## Buri's experiment

## Higher-order allele-frequency moments

## Linkage disequilibrium

## Mutation-drift equilibrium

## The detailed structure of neutral variation

### The infinite-alleles model and the associated allele-frequency spectrum

### The infinite-sites model and the associated site-frequency spectrum

## The genealogical structure of a population

## Mutation-migration-drift equilibrium

### Quantifying population structure: Fst

### Mutation-migration-drift equilirium values of Fst
