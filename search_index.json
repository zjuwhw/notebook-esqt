Sample size, time scale. 3.1 The Wright-Fisher Model Single finite populations of constant size within which mating is random; other Variant models: separate sexes; family size; generation overlap Its roots trace to Fisher (1922) and Wright (1931). Assume: a diploid population with a fixed number (N) of monoecious (hermaphroditic, 雌雄同体) adults random mating (self-fertilization included) discrete generations Consider a locus with two alleles B and b, without selection advantage: the probability (\\(P_{ij}\\)) that i copies of allele B in generation t and j copies of allele B in generation t+1 follows a binomial distribution: \\[P_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix}2N \\\\j \\end{pmatrix}(i/2N)^j[1-(i/2N)]^{2N-j}\\] Letting \\(\\boldsymbol{P} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{(2N+1)*(2N+1)}\\) that \\[\\boldsymbol{x}(t+1)=\\boldsymbol{x}(t)\\boldsymbol{P}\\] , where \\(\\boldsymbol{x}(t) \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{1*(2N+1)}\\), the probabilities that the allele is present in i=0,1,…,2N copies in generation t \\[x(t) = x(0)P^t\\] Markov chain Absorbing states: lost or fixed transition-matrix; diffusion approximation Moran model 3.2 Loss of heterozygosity by random genetic drift 3.3 Probabilities and times to fixation or loss 3.4 The age of a neutral allele 3.5 Allele-frequency divergence among populations 3.6 Buri’s experiment 3.7 Higher-order allele-frequency moments 3.8 Linkage disequilibrium 3.9 Mutation-drift equilibrium 3.10 The detailed structure of neutral variation 3.10.1 The infinite-alleles model and the associated allele-frequency spectrum 3.10.2 The infinite-sites model and the associated site-frequency spectrum 3.11 The genealogical structure of a population 3.12 Mutation-migration-drift equilibrium 3.12.1 Quantifying population structure: Fst 3.12.2 Mutation-migration-drift equilirium values of Fst "]]
